            This means that you present substantial
            portions or elements of anotherâ€™s work, ideas or data as your own,
            even if the original author is cited occasionally. A signed
            photocopy or other copy of the Declaration below must accompany
            every piece of work that you hand in.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I know that plagiarism is wrong. Plagiarism is to use the work of
        another and pass it off as my own.
    \item I have used the American Psychological Association formatting for
        citation and referencing. Each significant contribution to, and
        quotation in, this essay/project/report from the work or works of other
        people has been attributed, cited and referenced.
    \item This essay/project/report is my own work.
    \item \textbf{I have not allowed, and will not allow anyone to copy my work
        with the intention of passing it off as their own work.}
