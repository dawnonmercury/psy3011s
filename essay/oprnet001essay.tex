\section{Introduction}
Depression is a serious concern in Africa, and it is necessary to have a clear
idea about how countries across the continent are engaging with it, and what
Interventions can be effectively deployed to minimise it's impact on the mental
health burden. This essay will first discuss the prevalence of depression in
African countries. Next, this essay will discuss what Interventions have been
tested, whether they have been effective, and where they have been effective.
The quality of the evidence for these Interventions will be analysed, before
a final reflection will be made on the state of depression Interventions and
possible future directions for research and policy makers.\\
Depression and anxiety are among the most common mental disorders globally, and
cause a disproportionate amount of the global disability based healthcare
burden, a major contributor to morbidity, and a contributor to lower standard
of life (\cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{chibandaetal16}; \cite{douketal21};
\cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{logetal18}; \cite{lunetal14}).\\
Africa bears the brunt of the burden of common mental disorders, with
countries across sub-Saharan Africa alone accounting for at least 19\% of the
global mental health burden (\cite{lunderal15}). In specific countries, at
least 16.5\% of adults in South Africa present with a common disorder
(\cite{lunetal14}), and at least 30\% of people attending primary healthcare
facilities in Zimbabwe present with depression and anxiety symptoms
(\cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15}).\\
Further, Africa has the highest rates of people living with HIV/AIDS, a
population that is especially vulnerable to depression as compared to a general
population, and the highest rate of people living with HIV related depression
(\cite{logetal18}; \cite{petersenetal14}). This is a serious problem because
depression is strongly associated with lower rates of antiretroviral therapy
adherence which is necessary for good management of HIV/AIDS (\cite{logetal18};
\cite{lunetal14}; \cite{petersenetal14}). On a similar front, depression
severely affects young and expecting mothers, increasing the risk of
complications during pregnancy, impairing caregivers' ability to create an
environment suitable for a child, and limiting caregivers' ability to cope with
parenthood (\cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{nyatetal16}).\\
Despite the high prevalence of depression and other common mental disorders
across Africa, there is a serious lack of access to treatment and support
(\cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{chibandaetal16};
\cite{douketal21}; \cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{logetal18}). This is exacerbated
by the fact that only half of African countries have a mental health policy to
speak of (\cite{lunetal14}; \cite{lunderal15}), and most governments do not have
the ability to allocate the necessary funds to implement one if they had it
(\cite{douketal21}; \cite{logetal18}). The general lack of resources and
infrastructure for providing effective treatments means that there is an urgent
need to develop interventions that work, that have lasting effects, and that can
be deployed cheaply and efficiently (\cite{douketal21}; \cite{lunetal14};
\cite{lunderal15}).
\section{Interventions}
For an intervention to be considered evidence-based, it must be able to show
that they can effectively reduce a measure of symptoms for the target disorder
in a controlled trial (\cite{cook17}). Most interventions that are studied in
this way, and therefore fulfil this condition, are based on Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and are manualized interventions
(\cite{cook17}; \cite{shed18}). Because manualized therapies tend to require a
lower threshold of training in order to be implemented, they are particularly
suited to fulfil the needs of African governments and health practitioners in
bridging the treatment gap (\cite{cook17}; \cite{douketal21}; \cite{lunetal14}).\\
Generally, most of the data on low-cost interventions for low and middle income
countries comes from outside Africa, and while studies have been done more
recently in Africa, they are almost all from sub-Saharan Africa
(\cite{logetal18}). As expected, most of the readily available data is on
CBT based interventions (\cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{fernaetal21};
\cite{logetal18}; \cite{lunetal14}). Out of all the articles reviewed, only
Lofgren et al. (\citeyear{logetal18}) presented data on interventions other than
psychotherapies: six anti-depressant based interventions, a novel drug, an
exercise intervention, and three psychosocial interventions.\\
One of the key themes across these interventions was testing interventions that
could be delivered by minimally trained lay healthcare workers (LHWs) already
deployed in the field. Almost every single one of the psychotherapy interventions
followed this approach (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11};
\cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{chibandaetal16}; \cite{douketal21};
\cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{logetal18}; \cite{lunetal14}; \cite{nyatetal16};
\cite{petersenetal14}). Lofgren et al. (\citeyear{logetal18}) also reported on
three anti-depressant interventions delivered by LHWs.\\
The reason given for this approach is that LHWs are already deployed across
primary healthcare clinics, and can therefore cheaply and efficiently deliver
interventions that act as a preventative measure for serious mental disorder
that would otherwise require (costly) hospitalization (\cite{abasal16};
\cite{douketal21}; \cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{lunetal14}). Nyatsanza et al.
(\citeyear{nyatetal16}) also suggested that LHWs provide a built-in way to
ensure interventions are localized to and respect the cultural context where
they are being delivered.\\
The \textit{Friendship Bench Project}, initially developed for Zimbabwe,
has by far the most data out of any of the reviewed interventions.
Three trials are reviewed here (\cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15};
\cite{fernaetal21}), the project is one of the oldest interventions tested in
an African context (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{fernaetal21}).
The project uses LHWs who are already known and respected in the community to
deliver a low-intensity counselling program based on Problem Solving Therapy
(PST) (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{fernaetal21}). The LHWs
were trained generally for five to six days in basic counselling techniques and
in the intervention's specific program, and were based out of primary healthcare
clinics (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{fernaetal21}). PST was chosen because it could
it could very easily be adapted to a task-shifted intervention, and because it
proved to be both effective and flexible in the intervention studies
(\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15};
\cite{fernaetal21}). Over the course of up to six sessions, LHWs and clients
would identify the problems that the client faced, discuss the problems in a
safe and non-judgemental space, then collaboratively break down the problems
into manageable steps and develop step-by-step solutions to those problems
(\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{fernaetal21}). The intervention
was also accompanied by a group peer-support program, wherein clients of the
\textit{Friendship Bench} project met together regularly to support each other
emotionally, and to participate in income generating activities
(\cite{abasal16}; \cite{fernaetal21}).\\
This project is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, the
\textit{Friendship Bench} has been very succesfully upscaled in Zimbabwe, and
has generlly been well received by both clients and LHWs (\cite{abasal16};
\cite{fernaetal21}). This is important because it the lessons learned from this
can hopefully be applied to other projects in Africa. Secondly, this is one of
the few interventions that intentionally attends to the economic factors that
cause depression (\cite{fernaetal21}).\\
One of the first interventions developed based on the lessons of the
\textit{Friendship Bench} is the \textit{Inuka Coach} program developed for use
in Kenya (\cite{douketal21}). The program is based on the use of the
\textit{Friendship Bench}'s PST program, and it is also intended to be
delivered by LHWs as a low-intensity intervention. However, this program is
being developed to be delivered via a mobile application rather than in-person
(\cite{douketal21}). This delivery method is an attempt to address accesibility
issues by allowing clients to access the program from anywhere they have access
to a smart device and an internet connection (\cite{douketal21}). However, the
team behind this intervention reported some added difficulties introduced by
this method. LHWs required extra training in use of the application, and often
did not have access to smart devices capable of running the application; the
LHWs also often used their smart devices for personal business, which would
distract them from their client and run down their batteries
(\cite{douketal21}). Additionally, there could be no guarantee that clients
would have access to a smart device, a stable internet connection, or that
the application would be user-friendly (\cite{douketal21}). Lastly, mobile
based interventions are potentially very useful, such as Osborn et al.'s
(\citeyear{Osetal20}) \textit{Shamiri-Digital} intervention which seemed to
succesfully teach students skills which would help them navigate stress and
depression. However, this specifically intended to target prevention skills, it
was not an intervention for already existing depression, and more data is
necessary on how effective this approach can be.
\section{Quality of Evidence}
One of the most salient limitations of many interventions studies
is that the strict conditions of evidence gathering do not map onto their
practical, real world applications by their very nature (\cite{douketal21};
\cite{kaz14}; \cite{shed18}).The \textit{Inuka Coach} program ran into this
issue directly. For a variety of pragmatic reasons that Doukani et al.
(\citeyear{douketal21}) explain, they required the clients in the study to be
present in the clinic during the intervention, which if very different to the
intended use of the \textit{Inuka} application once it is fully launched.
This was noted in the study, but it does mean that there must still be
intensive testing of the intervention before it can really be called effective
for use in the privacy of clients' own homes.\\
On a similar note, studies for interventions often have incredibly strict
exclusion criteria, in order to experimentally isolate the effect of the
intervention on a single target, depression for example (\cite{kaz14};
\cite{shed18}). While this is part of good experimental practice, such as in
a chemistry experiment, it reinforces the above discussed problem of preventing
intervention evidence from being useful in real life contexts where depression
rarely manifests alone, and where multiple CMDs often have complex interactions
with each other (\cite{shed18}). Importantly, none of the interventions discussed
targeted depression alone. Rather, some interventions targeted depression
alongside other common mental disorders (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11};
\cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{chibandaetal16}; \cite{douketal21}); depression
specifically tied to living with HIV/AIDS (\cite{logetal18};
\cite{petersenetal14}); or otherwise targeted peri- and post-natal depression
(\cite{lunetal14}; \cite{nyatetal16}). This means that the studies might not be
as generalizable to other contexts, because the effect of the interventions are
not isolated to depression, but acknowledges that real-life people live complex
lives. \\
Some of the interventions did still exclude clients who were suicidal or
otherwise severely depressed as measured by the intervention's depression scale.
Chibanda et al. (\citeyear{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15}) and
Nyatsanza et al. (\citeyear{nyatetal16}) both explained that for the
\textit{Friendship Bench} they simply were not equipped to help people with
very severe symptoms and instead referred these clients to better equipped
clinics.\\
Something that is worrying in this pool of studies is that many of them are
only research proposals (\cite{chibandaetal15}; \cite{lunetal14}), or otherwise
only measured the effects of the interventions right after and after only a
brief three or six month follow-up (\cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal16};
\cite{douketal21}; \cite{fernaetal21}; \cite{nyatetal16}; \cite{petersenetal14}).
The link between depression and the other facets of peoples' lives
is intricately linked. The bi-directional relationship between poverty and
mental illness is very well supported (\cite{lundetal10}; \cite{lund12};
\cite{ridetal20}; \cite{wahl17}). People living with HIV/AIDS are also
more likely to develop depression (\cite{logetal18}). This means that without
treating the root causes of depression and other CMDs, even if six months after
the intervention there is still a positive effect, this effect will not last 
(\cite{kaz14}; \cite{shed18}).\\
Similarly, the measures that are used to see how effective an intervention is
do not properly map onto anything useful for clients (\cite{kaz14};
\cite{shed18}). Generally the studies used measures that were developed for
European and American contexts, but were validated for use in southern Africa
(\cite{lunetal14}; \cite{nyatetal16}; \cite{petersenetal14}).
While it is good that these measures seem to work in Africa, there is still a
concern that there is a mismatch between the items in the measures and the
real world context, and whether these items actually mean that clients have
experienced tangible benefits from the intervention(\cite{kaz14};
\cite{lunetal14}; \cite{nyatetal16}; \cite{shed18}). Only the \textit{Friendship
Bench} studies addressed this issue. First, they used the Shona Symptom
Questionnaire, a measure that was actively created for the Zimbabwe context,
using local idioms for various aspects of depression and other CMDs. Second,
these studies all supported their quantitative data with very robust
qualitative data that showed directly how much of an impact the program has had
on clients' lives (\cite{abasal16}; \cite{chibandaetal11}; \cite{chibandaetal15};
\cite{chibandaetal16}; \cite{fernaetal21}).
\section{Reflection}
One of the things that struck me when I began research for this essay was how
little attention many interventions seem to pay towards root causes of CMDs.
Despite the relationship between poverty and mental health being very well
documented, as discussed above, and despite how relevant poverty is across all
African contexts. While psychotherapy interventions can only do so much outside
the treatment of CMDs themselves, there should be at least an acknowledgment of
the effects of poverty, if not some attempt to address part of the problem. As
I mentioned above, without something in place to treat causal factors of
depression, any effects of an intervention can only have a limited effect.\\
The \textit{Friendship Bench} project seems to be incredibly promising because
of this. It was the only intervention I found that did attempt to give clients
tools that they needed in order to minimise the effect of poverty on their lives.
The program also seems very good for the reasons discussed above, with regards
to how effective it is and how well clients respond to it.\\
There was definitely a lack of studies for interventions in Africa from the
beginning of the last decade. However, much more recently there has been an
increase in interventions piloted for an African context, such as Doukani et al
(\citeyear{douketal21}), Fernando et al (\citeyear{fernaetal21}), Nyatsanza
et al (\citeyear{nyatetal16}).
